# The-Holy-Treenity
Game for the 20 Million Trees Game Jam

**Game Engine**: Godot

**Assets/Scripts**: All made by myself, for jam only

I used Affinity Designer for the graphics. (Some parts are rendered dynamically by Godot itself, but not much.)

**Sound**: 

Used Bxfr for the sound effects

And this free online tool used for making the background music: https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Song-Maker/

The soundtrack is nothing more than a few of these loops that are randomly combined (sometimes there's multiple voices playing)
