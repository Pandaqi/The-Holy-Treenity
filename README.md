# The-Holy-Treenity
Game for the 20 Million Trees Game Jam. Play it for free at: https://pandaqi.itch.io/the-holy-treenity

**How to use this project:** 
*  To create your own levels, create a "new inherited scene" and choose "LevelSkeleton.tscn" as the base scene. 
*  This will create a new scene that already has all the right nodes, scripts, tiles, etc. 
*  You can draw the level by clicking on the "TileMap" node and simply drawing the tiles where you want them.
*  Give your scene a name (like "Level6.tscn") and make sure there's a button in the main menu that points to it. (If unsure, check the current code and structure in the menu scripts.)
*  On the main node ('Node2D' at the top of the tree), there's a variable called "Simulation Parameters". This is a list of ALL the parameters used in the simulation (how much oxygen a tree produces, the heat level that determines if water should freeze or not, etc.) Change these however you like and see what kind of results you get!

Of course, you can also simply study the project to learn about the Godot Game Engine (or certain algorithms I used, such as Cellular Automata). Or you could just play the game and have fun.

**Game Engine**: Godot

**Assets/Scripts**: All made by myself, for jam only. I used Affinity Designer for the graphics. (Some parts are rendered dynamically by Godot itself, like the water, but not much.)

**Sound Effects**: Used the free, online Bxfr. Just played around a bit with the parameters.

**Soundtrack**: this free online tool => https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Song-Maker/

The soundtrack is nothing more than a few of these loops that are randomly combined (sometimes there's multiple voices playing)
